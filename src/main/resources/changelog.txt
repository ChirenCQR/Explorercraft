CHANGELOG:

3.2.2
+ added Custom Villager Trades (might be conflict with other mods)
+ tweaked world generation of the Slate Dungeon code (possible fix to an issue someone was having)
+ Fixed Polished Basalt, Marble and Slate all dropping bricks and not polished variants - no idea how that slipped through and for how long!
+ Tweaked and changed functionality of the Wizard Trading - the initial wizard I spawned in the structure, all his trades were duplicated, so now the wizard has poor memory and randomly changes his mind on what he's selling! :P
+ added Jade Longbow added
+ added Enderghast to the End
