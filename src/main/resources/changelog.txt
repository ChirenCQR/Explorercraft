CHANGELOG:

Patch 3.2.2:
+ added Custom Villager Trades (might be conflict with other mods)
+ tweaked world generation of the Slate Dungeon code (possible fix to an issue someone was having)
+ Fixed Polished Basalt, Marble and Slate all dropping bricks and not polished variants - no idea how that slipped through and for how long!
+ Tweaked and changed functionality of the Wizard Trading - the initial wizard I spawned in the structure, all his trades were duplicated, so now the wizard has poor memory and randomly changes his mind on what he's selling! :P
+ added Jade Longbow added
+ added Enderghast to the End

Patch 3.2.3:
- Removed a config conflict where disabling the enderreeper disabled both the enderghast + enderreeper and the enderghast config did nothing
+ Added new rare spawns to the enderreeper spawning in the overworld and nether biome, similar to the enderman (these are configurable)
+ Special thanks to MasterSloth1 for providing me with OreDict variants of my tools/armors recipes which allow for other mod gems to be used to make explorercraft tools!
+ Added Russian translation
+ Modified Enderghast spawns slightly
+ Added Enderghast Spawn egg to language file
